# Louisville Metro Employee Salary Dashboard

This project analyzes salary data for employees of **Louisville Metro Government**, covering over **40,000 records** across **73 departments**. The goal is to provide insights into **salary distribution**, **department headcounts**, **overtime trends**, and **top-earning positions**. This analysis helps improve transparency, understand salary trends, and support data-driven decisions regarding public sector compensation.

## Important Terminology:

* **Total Salary**: The sum of base salary, overtime, and incentives for an employee in a given year.
* **Overtime Share**: The proportion of an employee's earnings that come from overtime work.
* **Incentive Share**: The percentage of an employeeâ€™s total salary derived from bonuses or performance incentives.

# Summary

The dataset contains 40,000 records, revealing insights into employee salaries, departmental distributions, and top earners. The dashboard was built using Power BI, enabling interactive filtering by year and department. The analysis **highlights key trends in public sector compensation, including salary growth over time, departments with the highest headcounts, and overtime pay distribution**.

## Key Insights

* **Salary Trends Over Time**:
   - The average total salary has shown a steady increase from 2020 to 2025.
   - The top earners in the dataset are high-ranking officials in law enforcement and government leadership roles.

* **Departmental Analysis**:
   - The Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) has the highest number of employees, followed by Louisville Fire Department and Parks & Recreation.
   - Certain departments rely heavily on overtime pay, particularly in emergency management and law enforcement.

* **Overtime and Incentive Trends**:
   - Overtime pay accounts for a significant portion of salaries in departments like Louisville Fire and Emergency Management.
   - The incentive share remains low across most departments, indicating that public-sector compensation relies more on base salary and overtime rather than performance-based incentives.

* **Top Earners**:
   - The highest-paid employees are primarily Police Chiefs, Directors, and Deputy Mayors.
   -  Gwinn Villaroel Jacquelyn and Paul Louis Humphrey have consistently ranked among the top five highest-paid employees from 2021 to 2025.

# Recommendations

* **Overtime Budget Optimization**: Since departments like Fire and Emergency Management rely heavily on overtime pay, city officials should assess workload distribution and consider hiring more staff to reduce overtime expenses.
* **Salary Transparency for Public Awareness**: Publishing annual reports on salary distribution can improve government transparency and ensure fair compensation across all roles.
* **Performance-Based Incentives**: The city might explore increasing incentive-based pay in key roles to reward high performance while potentially reducing reliance on overtime pay.
* **Departmental Staffing Review**: With LMPD and Louisville Fire being the largest departments, further analysis can help determine if current staffing levels are optimal or if resources should be reallocated.

# Assumptions and Limitations

- The dataset only includes Louisville Metro Government employees, excluding state or federal workers.
- Some salary fluctuations could be influenced by policy changes, promotions, or emergency response efforts not explicitly recorded in the dataset.
- The overtime trends may not account for all external factors, such as major city events or budget reallocations impacting compensation.
- Missing Pay Details: The dataset did not fully break down regular pay, overtime, or specific bonus strcutures, which may limit precise salary calculations. 

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for analyzing salary trends, department structures, and workforce expenses, helping government officials, analysts, and the public make data-driven decisions regarding Louisville Metro employee compensation.
