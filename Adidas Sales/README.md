# Adidas Sales Performance Dashboard
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Adidas' sales performance across different regions, retailers, and product categories. By leveraging sales data, the dashboard offers insights into revenue trends, unit sales, and profit margins. The goal is to identify key sales drivers, highlight top-performing locations, and support data-driven decision-making for Adidas' business strategy.

## Important Terminology:

* **Unit Sales**: The total number of Adidas products sold across different regions and retailers.
* **Operating Margin**: A profitability metric that measures earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of total revenue.

## Summary
The dataset includes extensive sales records, providing a detailed view of Adidas' market performance. The dashboard, built using interactive visualizations, enables filtering by region, retailer, and time period. It highlights crucial insights, including sales distribution across major cities, revenue trends, and product category performance.

## Key Insights
* **Sales Trends Over Time**:
- Total sales have shown steady growth, with peak periods aligning with major product launches and seasonal promotions.
- The highest sales volumes occur in key metropolitan areas, with online sales contributing significantly to overall revenue.
* **Regional and Retail Analysis**:
- North America is one of the strongest markets, with cities like Los Angeles and New York leading in sales.
